# Create a new project `music_web_app_html` using the new HTML starter for this phase.

You can copy over your albums-related code from the previous challenges if you want to, rather than starting over from scratch. You'll probably want these files (although your chosen filenames might differ!):


Test-drive a `GET /albums` route that connects with an 
`AlbumRepository` and the 
database to return a result like this:

<!-- GET /albums -->
```html
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Albums</h1>

    <div>
      Title: Doolittle
      Released: 1989
    </div>

    <div>
      Title: Surfer Rosa
      Released: 1988
    </div>

    <!-- ... -->
  </body>
</html>
```
